# vrpr 0.1.0

First release.

* A tidy, pipe-friendly R interface to the 'PyVRP' vehicle routing solver. PyVRP's
  high-performance C++ core is vendored and rewired through 'cpp11', with no
  'Python' runtime dependency.
* Supports the capacitated VRP, time windows (VRPTW), heterogeneous fleets,
  multiple depots (MDVRP), prize-collecting (optional clients and mutually
  exclusive client groups), simultaneous pickup and delivery / backhaul, and
  multi-trip routes.
* `read_vrplib()` and `read_solomon()` read standard VRPLIB/TSPLIB and Solomon
  instances; `plot()` draws solutions with 'ggplot2'.
* The solver is a faithful port of PyVRP's iterated local search; objective and
  solution-quality parity with PyVRP is verified in `tools/benchmark/`.
